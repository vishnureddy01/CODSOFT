## Codsoft AI Project

Welcome to the Codsoft AI Project repository! This project is a comprehensive exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques implemented in Python. From foundational machine learning algorithms to cutting-edge deep learning models, this repository covers a wide range of AI concepts and applications.

### Features
- **Task Implementations:** Dive into our collection of AI task implementations, covering areas such as:
  - Machine Learning Models
  - Deep Learning Architectures
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Computer Vision
  - Reinforcement Learning
- **Documentation:** Each task comes with detailed documentation, providing insights into algorithms, code samples, and practical usage instructions.
- **Example Datasets:** We've included sample datasets to facilitate experimentation and learning.
- **Code Snippets:** In addition to complete implementations, find useful code snippets and utilities for common AI tasks.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary language for implementation.
- **Libraries:** Utilizes popular Python libraries and frameworks including NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.

### Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and explore the task implementations. Each task directory contains a README with instructions on running the code and experimenting with parameters.
